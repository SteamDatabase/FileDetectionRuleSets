# Known un-detected or chronically under-counted technologies

## The following engines are known to be underreported by our heuristics

### HaxeFlixel

HaxeFlixel is one of the most popular engines built on Lime/OpenFL but gives off no particular signal of its own. The best we can do is detect Lime/OpenFL.

### Construct

We detect Construct games based on the presence of a particular JS file. However, it is possible to package all the content in a package.nw file, which hides this information from us and makes it indistinguishable from a generic Node.JS game. The best we can do for these missing cases is detect NodeJS.

### GameMaker

It is possible to package a GameMaker game as a standalone executable with no supporting files, or only very generic ones.

### Godot

Godot games can also be packaged as standalone executables with no external asset files.

### GDevelop

GDevelop also doesn't have any non-generic files, so detection is kind of impossible.

## The following SDKs are known to be undetected by our heurestics

### Havok

Games using Havok SDK Suite (Physics, Cloth and AI) are usually don't have any special files for them, so we can not detect them.
