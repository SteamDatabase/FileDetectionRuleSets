2D Fighter Maker 95 was released for Windows by ASCII prior to their departure from gaming.
The engine can be used to make games similar to professional games released for the NeoGeo and Sony Playstation,
such as the King of Fighters series, and Street Fighter 3rd strike.
Released by ASCII's successor company, [**Enterbrain**](http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/), 2D Fighter Maker 2nd allowed for a greater amount of expansion and extension than FM95,
revising much of the original engine to allow more options while adding a menu-based system for clarity.
