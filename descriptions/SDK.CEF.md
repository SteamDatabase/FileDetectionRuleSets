[**Chromium Embedded Framework**](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/) is an open-source software framework for embedding a Chromium web browser within another application. This enables developers to add web browsing functionality to their application, as well as the ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the application's user interface (or just portions of it).
