[**OHRRPGCE**](https://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Main_Page) (or Official Hamster Republic Role Playing Game Construction Engine) is a [**free**](https://bob-the-hamster.itch.io/ohrrpgce) and [**open-source**](https://github.com/ohrrpgce),
cross-platform, and easy-to-use game making tool kit.
OHRRPGCE can be used to create your own 2D RPG game in a style similar to the classic Final Fantasy games which have shaped the RPG genre.
No programming is required to create a game, though you can create other types of games with the built in Hspeak scripting language.
The OHRRPGCE is created by James Paige and Ralph Versteegen, as well as many other contributors.
