[**Lime**](https://lime.software/) is a flexible, lightweight layer for Haxe cross-platform developers. Lime provides a common foundation on native and dynamic targets for window and application life-cycle management, access to rendering and sound, plus many other useful features for cross-platform development.

[**OpenFL**](https://www.openfl.org/) is a free and open-source software framework and platform for the creation of multi-platform applications and video games. OpenFL applications can be written in Haxe, JavaScript, or TypeScript.

Since OpenFL is built on Lime, we are currently unable to distinguish between them, which is why they are grouped under the same rule.
