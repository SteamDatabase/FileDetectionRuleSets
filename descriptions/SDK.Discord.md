[**Discord's Sdk**](https://discord.com/rich-presence) is an integration to interact with the chat program Discord, it allows games to do Rich Presence in Discord, use its Lobby System or even use its Voice System. Discord's integration is provided through 2 way, an SDK, Discord GameSDK and a deprecated lib, Discord-RPC, it's to be noted that the deprecated lib can only provide Rich Presence.
