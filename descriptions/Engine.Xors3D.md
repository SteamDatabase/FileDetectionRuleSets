Xors3d is a middleware solution for game developers, born as a library which extends functionality of Blitz3d by implementing a DirectX9-rendering.
It later grew into an independent engine.
This engine can be used not only for anything from simple visualizations to complex simulations as well.
Using Xors3d you're able to construct games of any genre by writing less code in a shorter amount of time.
Xors3d combines simplicity, flexibility, and power.
It has inherited the simplicity of Blitz3d.
But at the same time Xors3d has a lot of new features give the users total control over their 3d worlds.
