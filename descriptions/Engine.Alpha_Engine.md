[**DigiPen's**](https://www.digipen.edu.sg/) Alpha Engine is a propiertary in-house engine used by their students.
Alpha Engine provides functions to create a window, draw graphics, get input, and a few other things.
By the end of the semester, students must transition away from using the fully-featured Alpha DLL to using a stripped-down one that only provides the window and graphics functions.
