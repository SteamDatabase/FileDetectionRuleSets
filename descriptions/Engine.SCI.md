[**SCI**](http://www.scriptinterpreter.com/) which Sierra referred to as both the "Script Code Interpreter" and later "Sierra's Creative Interpreter", is a p-machine style virtual machine for executing platform-independent, object-oriented code. It was initially created in 1988 to replace AGI and was first used in King's Quest IV released the same year.
