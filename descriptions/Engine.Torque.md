Torque covers a series of both proprietary and open-source cross-platform 3D game engines, originally developed by GarageGames and actively maintained under the current versions [**Torque 3D**](https://torque3d.org/torque3d/) and [**Torque 2D**](https://torque3d.org/torque2d/).
The original proprietary engines were never open-sourced except for later versions of Torque 3D and Torque 2D.
