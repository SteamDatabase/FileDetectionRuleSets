[**FluidSynth**](https://www.fluidsynth.org/) is a real-time [**open source**](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2 specifications.
FluidSynth itself does not have a GUI, but due to its powerful API several applications utilize it and it has even found its way onto embedded systems and is used in some mobile apps.
