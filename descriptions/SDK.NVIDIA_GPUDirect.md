[**NVIDIA GPUDirectÂ®**](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) is a family of technologies, part of [Magnum IO](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/magnum-io/), that enhances data movement and access for NVIDIA data center GPUs. Using GPUDirect, network adapters and storage drives can directly read and write to/from GPU memory, eliminating unnecessary memory copies, decreasing CPU overheads and reducing latency, resulting in significant performance improvements. These technologies - including GPUDirect Storage, GPUDirect Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), GPUDirect Peer to Peer (P2P) and GPUDirect Video - are presented through a comprehensive set of APIs.
