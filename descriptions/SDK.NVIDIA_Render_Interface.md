[**NVIDIA Render Interface**](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/NRI) is a low-level abstract render interface which currently supports three backends: D3D11, D3D12 and Vulkan. NVIDIA Render Interface has been designed to support all (at least major) low level features of D3D12 and Vulkan APIs, but at the same time to simplify usage and reduce the amount of code needed (especially compared with Vulkan). NVIDIA Render Interface is written in C++, but supports both C++ and C interfaces.
